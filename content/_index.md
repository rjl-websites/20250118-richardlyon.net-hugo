_Hello._

Thank you for being here! 

I'm Richard Lyon. This is my personal website.

You'll find essays on matters of interest. These are generally written to help me think about a subject, not to attempt to persuade you what to think about one.

You'll also find write ups on various projects.

And you'll find some snaps.
